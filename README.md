# Stanford ArduPilot Project

This is a fork of the ArduPilot project to expose state and control variables for building custom autopilot control laws for Stanford AA241X.

You can find lots of development information at the [ArduPilot development site](http://dev.ardupilot.com)

At the moment, this code only builds on a windows machine...


## Getting this source to your machine

Two options:

1. You can download the source using the "ZIP" button at the top
of the github page.  

2. You can make a clone using git, see the instructions here -- [Dev.Ardupilot] (http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/building-ardupilot-with-arduino-windows/)

The second option is prefered to allow you to pull future updates of the base code.


## Building

To build this source you will need a Windows operating system with the custom Arduino development environment available.  Instructions on setting this up can be found here -- [Dev.Ardupilot] (http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/building-ardupilot-with-arduino-windows/)

## Wiki
Most or all of the relevant information on how to use StarduPlane will be available at the project's [Wiki] (https://github.com/rbunge/StarduPlane/wiki), under the "Pages" tab.


# Development Team

The StarduPilot project is beasted by Robbie Bunge.
